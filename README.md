# Static-Website-hosting-on-AWS-using-s3
Hello Everyone. In this first project of mine I have tried this simple project of hosting a static website using AWS. It involves the usage of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
# What is the static website?
A static website is one that appears in a web browser precisely as it is stored. It is often referred to as a flat or motionless page. It consists of HTML-coded web pages with static content that are kept on a web server. It remains constant, unchanging, or "static" for each and every website visitor.
# What is Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)?
The object storage service Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides performance, security, scalability, and data availability that are among the best in the business. To store and safeguard any volume of data for a variety of use cases, including data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archiving, business applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics, customers of all sizes and sectors can utilize Amazon S3. It can optimize, arrange, and configure access to your data using the administration tools that Amazon S3 offers to satisfy your unique organizational, business, and compliance needs.
